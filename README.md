Working on a 2D game about autism with a friend, doing the music and programming while he does all the art. 
We are trying, from our experience with close relatives that have this condition, to represent what it is, and truly spread it around.
Updates of it will be posted here, including betas. We predict it will be close to done nearing the end of 2023. Suggestions are incredibly appreciated.
